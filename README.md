# Project Edelweiss (Work in Progress)



Edelweiss is a lightweight consensus protocol simulator.

For safer and better consensus protocols!

The program has been tested under python3.5 and python3.6

## Features

1. *Easy to implement new protocols*
2. *Understanding existing protocols*
3. *Easy to attack*

## Goal

- Run and test existing consensus like [BOSCO](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/52180438.pdf),NaiveVoting,DolevStrong in a straightforward way,you can see the
middle and final results of the running of the protocol and get to understand the protocols quickly.

- Provide a set of controllers,environments,settings,adversaries result measures and Communication techniques so that you can easily implement and test your new consensus protocols without worring about the 'dirty work' of implementing it.

- Simulate the kinds of attacks that is theoretical possible but difficulty to achieve or observe in real distributed systems. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Python3](https://www.python.org/getit/)

## download

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Coding/WebIDE.git
```

## Run an experiment

```sh
python Main.py
```

or

```sh
python3 Main.py
```
